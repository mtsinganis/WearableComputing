# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The data set used here is data collected from the accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

### Contents

  - `CodeBook.md` - Describes the experiment data and the steps taken to summarize the data.
  - `run_analysis.R` - R script to merge, clean-up, transform, and summarize the experiment data.
  - `run_data_summary.txt` - Output file generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.
  - `README.md` - This file.


The `run_analysis.R` does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
