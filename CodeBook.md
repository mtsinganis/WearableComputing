## Data sources and experiment background

* Original experiment description
    * [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Experiment](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
* Dataset is available at :
    * [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip )

Original data and experiment description
> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

> The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

**Aim of our analysis is to tidy data, only focusing on mean and standard deviation measurements**

## Study design : Data collecting process, transformations

First, data are retrieved from [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

Original dataset is, by design, split into 2 distinct datasets (one for training (70% of original data), the other for testing (30% remaining))

The process consists in:

* Getting data
    * First of all
        * `y_train.txt` and `y_test.txt` : Performed and measured activities
            * Single column .txt file
        * `subject_train.txt` and `subject_test.txt` : Individuals participating in tests (represented by a number)
            * Single column .txt file
        * `features.txt` : Names of measurements
            * Single column .txt file 
        * `X_train.txt` and `X_test.txt` : Measurements
            * 561-column .txt file
* Merging dataset
    * Training and Test datasets are merged
    * **At this step, 2 data frames are merged into a single one**
* Only keeping mean and standard deviation
    * Column names are filtered so as to contain only measurements corresponding to mean and standard deviation 
* Importing table hat matches `activity` IDs to the names of measurements
    * The first column of this data frame is named `activity_ID` to match the column from the full data frame. This         allows `activity_ID` to be used as a primary key to merge the two data frames
        * Factor levels: "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", "LAYING"
* Labelize all features
    * All 86 features are labelized for easy understanding of data
* **Generate final tidydata**
    * **Grouped by subject and activity**
    * **Get average values for each mean and standard deviation measurements**
